The John Campe Show","On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Thursday, November 16th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon -  Ali - My question is how can the studios release films that have seemingly incomplete or poor CGI ? Is it because they have a deadline to keep? Or they ran out of budget? Or simply they haven't noticed it? If people like you and I can see that its poor CGI work, how come the experts in studios are comfortable in releasing the films with it?\n\nPATREON Supporter Anurag P - Big fan since the AMC days. I don't know if you have seen the most recent trailer of the new Brie Larson movie Basmati Blues, but the trailer as a whole really gave off the impression of another white person trying to come to India to save it while playing on common Indian stereotypes. As an Indian myself it is increasingly frustrating seeming so many Indian actors being typecast or Indian culture being used in such fashion.\n\nAlejandro Alonzo - Hey John!  It has been the case that a lot of Marvel movies have bad villains, but great heroe development. Critics usually like those movies enough to give them a fresh review on RT. We've been hearing similar comments about JL, if it turns out this movie gets a rotten. Is there a case to be made that there is a negative bias around WB, or a positive one around Marvel?\n\nPATREON Supporter Alan Dale - Hi John,  when you talk about all time highest box office grossing movies why isn't adjusted for inflation taken into account? Surely the box office is based on the number of actual tickets sold per film? Im sure the all time top 10 list of films would look very different. Can you please explain this as it‚Äôs always puzzled me. Thanks and keep up the great work.\n\nFrancisca Ramirez - Ben being done as Batman seems like a foregone conclusion at this point. Is Matt Reeves is still working on a stand alone Batman film or would that be cancelled if Affleck walks?"

Here today, we have a unique car commercial for you guys. A commercial that features the Pontiac lineup for 1991, with the voice of Patrick Stewart narrating over the commercial! Some of the vehicles featured in this commercial are already talked about in my other car commercial videos like the LeMans and Bonneville, so I'll talk about the Pontiac Grand Prix featured in this commercial. \n\nThe Grand Prix had a base 3.1 Liter, 6 cylinder engine that produced 140 horsepower at 4400 RPM with 185 LB-FT of Torque at 3200 RPM. A more powerful 3.4 Liter V6 that produced 210 Horsepower was available as an option.\n\nThe base transmission  on the Grand Prix was a 3 speed automatic, with a 4 speed automatic and 5 speed manual being available as options. Fuel mileage with the optional 4 speed automatic was a decent 17 MPG city, 28 MPG highway. \n\nTwo body styles were offered on the Grand Prix; a 2 door coupe or 4 door sedan. The GT model trim only came in a 2 door coupe.\n \nThree trim levels were offered on the Grand Prix; the LE base trim, the SE mid range trim, the more luxurious STE model trim, and the sport oriented GT trim. The MSRP for the LE entry level trim in a 4 door sedan layout was $14,779, the MSRP for the SE mid range trim was $15,769, the MSRP for the luxury STE model trim in a 4 door layout was $20,479 and the MSRP for the 2 door GT coupe was $19,369.\n\nIf you wanted a modestly priced sport oriented 2 and 4 door vehicle that was Domestic, provided somewhat good performance, matched with decent gas mileage and sleek looks in 1991, then the Pontiac Grand Prix was the car for you.\n\nThere are many more old car commercials uploaded on my channel and many more to come, so check my channel often for more videos!\n\n(Disclosure: I do not own this old car advertisement commercial as it belongs to the General Motors Automobile Corporation.)"

He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOX‚Äôs Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy‚Äôs destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Suddenly he thought: This was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act.\n\nEach paid attendee will receive, Brian Cranston‚Äôs riveting memoir, A Life in Parts, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to to mega-stardom and a cult-like following\n\nAt the Hudson Union with great humor, and much humility, Cranston will chronicle his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular, trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly.  \n\nCranston will dive deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin."

The Green Book was a unique travel guide during this time, when segregation was practiced all over the country.\n\nThe book, which grew to cover locations in all 50 states, listed hotels, restaurants, gas stations, beauty salons, and other services that would reliably serve African Americans. The listings grew from user correspondence and a network of African American postal workers under the guidance of Victor Hugo Green, the book‚Äôs publisher.\n\nThe American road trip would go on to be an anchor in the civil rights discussion, as it highlighted the injustices and prejudice that African Americans suffered under Jim Crow. Before the Civil Rights Act outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations, Victor Green‚Äôs booklet helped black Americans navigate their country. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Female condoms are almost as effective as male condoms, so why are they so hard to find?\n\nFemale condoms have been around since the 1980‚Äôs, when a Danish doctor named Lasse Hessel came up with a prototype. It was brought to the US in the 90‚Äôs under the name FC1 but the media ridiculed it, comparing it to a plastic bag.\n\nThe FC2 came out a few years later but it wasn‚Äôt marketed very well and the original stigma still stuck around. In 2017, the company that manufactures them stopped selling them in stores and changed to a prescription-only model, so you need to see a doctor to get one.\n\nBut sexual health advocates say that we should give female condoms another chance. They're the only female-initiated method of preventing STIs (including HIV) and unplanned pregnancies and many say they‚Äôre preferable for anal sex as well. \n\nPutting them back in retail stores and raising awareness on the marketplace could give them a second wind and increase their usage. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Bringing to a shocking conclusion events set in motion in 2015 and 2017‚Äôs blockbuster films that grossed almost $950 million globally, the film arrives for Valentine‚Äôs Day 2018.\n \nBelieving they have left behind shadowy figures from their past, newlyweds Christian and Ana fully embrace an inextricable connection and shared life of luxury.  But just as she steps into her role as Mrs. Grey and he relaxes into an unfamiliar stability, new threats could jeopardize their happy ending before it even begins.\n \nAlso returning from prior Fifty Shades entries are Academy Award¬Æ winner Marcia Gay Harden, Eric Johnson, Rita Ora, Luke Grimes, Victor Rasuk, Jennifer Ehle, Eloise Mumford, Max Martini, Callum Keith Rennie, Bruce Altman and Robinne Lee, who are joined for the first time by Arielle Kebbel and Brant Daugherty.\n \nFifty Shades Freed is directed by Fifty Shades Darker‚Äôs James Foley (Fear, House of Cards) and once again produced by Michael De Luca, Dana Brunetti and Marcus Viscidi, alongside E L James, the creator of the culture-spanning blockbuster series.

My woodburning stove is not the most efficient for primary heating, so I show exactly how it functions and what I can do to make it more efficient, saving wood and money in the process. It's interesting to see my dog, Cali the Golden Retriever, show up on the thermal image and how cool she is compared to the surrounding walls, table and bed that she's lying on.\nThe tiny house should be very easy to heat once the pointing (mortar) is done inside and out and I can use what I've learned on this log cabin to help me design and build the other structures on my wilderness homestead. Working and collecting firewood alone is challenging, so I want to maximize the efficiency of each building in order to make this long term off grid survival situation more economically feasible. If I can reduce the amount of fuel needed to heat each off grid building, I can provide all of the energy I need for free from the property. This is going to require the installation of rocket stove (rocket mass heater) to use the wood more efficiently.\nI have a few upcoming diy projects that this thermal scan technology will help with - the bread oven, the sauna, the workshop and the maple sugar shack.\n\nLinks to Products Used: \n\nSolar LED light bulb 15W \n \n\n\nAgawa Canyon Boreal 21 Saw\n Fairy lights\n String Lights\n 12 round \n Lodge Dutch Oven\n heat resistant gloves up to 500 degrees\n baking stone\n  Knife\n OiI\n \n\nWall Lantern (candle lit)\n \n\nMoka Pot\n  Canada\n  USA\n\nCanon 6D\n Mavic Pro\n Sprinkle\n see what I‚Äôm up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite:  ‚Äì  Facebook Page (Shawn James) ‚Äì  ‚Äì  Address:\nP.O.

This is the second oldest thing I've ever eaten (Oldest was that Hardtack) and much unexpected considering this MRE's condition. It was pretty rough - and the smell when cooking the dried beef (Pretty much a pemmican) is nearly indescribable. It was quite the experience. And for old rations up next we will see the next generation in Emergency Rations - (1918). This is pioneering in food technology - the beef was still edible. It was a pulverized, slow cooked, dried, and compressed meat by-product bar.

Gilbert asks Eggert, Alexander says he witnessed this the first year of the show, which would make you 14? Eggert responds, 14-years-old, 1986 and before I was 15-years-old, he had me at his home, in his car, in his garage and he penetrated my vagina with his finger and this is where it began and this continued almost on a weekly basis for years.

Other than that brief period on Game of Thrones when she dyed her hair black, the lady of Winterfell never strays from her signature red color. But the actress that plays her, Sophie Turner, is far more experimental. She's dyed her hair from blonde to red and back again more times than she'd like to recall. Turner's also been the face of haircare brand Wella Professionals since June 2017, so it's safe to say she knows a thing or two about good hair.\nOf all the hairstyles on Game of Thrones, braids reign supreme. To test her knowledge, we asked Turner to look at a series of hairstyles and guess whether they were from Westeros or the runway. \n\nSubscribe to Harper's Bazaar: "

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot. As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy. Originally conceived as a concept album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the show eventually made its way to the stage in 1971 and garnered five Tony nominations in addition to winning a Drama Desk Award for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Now this globally celebrated classic comes to NBC in 2018 for a one-of-a-kind live staging on Easter Sunday that's sure to amaze with jaw-dropping spectacle, an all-star cast of beloved recording artists and a fresh soundtrack featuring such hits as Heaven on Their Minds, I Don't Know How to Love Him and Superstar.\n\nSuperstar: Brandon Victor Dixon - Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\n on YouTube\n"

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars."

Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summer‚Äôs events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dad‚Äôs footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdale‚Äôs young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. It‚Äôs all weighing heavily on Archie‚Äôs mind ‚Äî as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but she‚Äôs not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Betty‚Äôs nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (M√§dchen Amick), aren‚Äôt the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), there‚Äôs an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesn‚Äôt want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then there‚Äôs Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdale‚Äôs Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason? Riverdale may look like a quiet, sleepy town, but there are dangers in the shadows. \nBased on the characters from Archie Comics, RIVERDALE is from Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions, with executive producers Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúGlee‚Äù), Greg Berlanti (‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow‚Äù), Sarah Schechter (‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow‚Äù) and Jon Goldwater (Archie Comics).\n\nConnect with RIVERDALE Online:\nLearn more about RIVERDALE :  RIVERDALE on FACEBOOK: RIVERDALE on TWITTER:  RIVERDALE on INSTAGRAM:  The CW:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for the CW Television Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow, Dynasty, Valor, Supernatural, Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Originals, The 100, iZombie, Black Lightning, and Life Sentence.\n\nConnect with The CW Online:\nVisit The CW WEBSITE:  The CW on FACEBOOK:  The CW on TWITTER:  \nFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM:  The CW on TUMBLR:  The CW on GOOGLE+:  The CW on PINTEREST:  \nRiverdale | Chapter Twenty-Three: The Blackboard Jungle Trailer | The CW\n"

For the past 5 weeks, I've been working in the ICU, facing so much death and so many grieving families... at times it has been incredibly difficult. There often isn't time to process your emotions during the day while you are working and these experiences can build up.\n\nThe question becomes: how do you process these experiences in a healthy way? I believe this happens on many levels. \nFirst is at the level of the team, with debriefing and discussions. In the ICU we actually do some formal sessions after challenging codes (when a patient's heart stops or they stop breathing) with all the doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and students. \nThen it's important to figure out what works best for you - do you process thoughts through journaling? exercising? blogging? \nPersonally I find talking to trusted friends, family and colleagues is the best way for me to process my thoughts and emotions.\n\nI want this video to remind you to TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF and to LOOK OUT FOR OTHERS who may be struggling! We all experience highs and lows in life. \n\nThank you so much for watching! I know this was a heavy topic and different than my usual vlogs in hospital.

D grows up under the wing of a Kingston Don and music producer named King Fox (Sheldon Shepherd). Fox dispatches him to London, where he reconnects with his childhood sweetheart, Yvonne (Shantol Jackson), and his daughter who he's not seen since she was a baby. He also hooks up with a soundclash crew, called High Noon. But before he can be convinced to abandon his life of crime and follow the righteous path, he encounters the man who shot his brother 10 years earlier, and embarks on a bloody, explosive quest for retribution - a quest which brings him into conflict with vicious London gangster Rico (Stephen Graham).\n\nFollow the Yardie film channels for more updates:\n\nfacebook.com/YardieFilm \ntwitter.com/YardieFilm\ninstagram.com/YardieFilm"

In an April 4, 1967, appearance at the New York City Riverside Church ‚Äî exactly one year before his death ‚Äî King delivered Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence. In the speech he spoke strongly against the U.S.'s role in the war, insisting that the U.S. was in Vietnam to occupy it as an American colony and calling the U.S. government the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.\nNow, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity and life of America today can ignore the present war. If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read: Vietnam. It can never be saved so long as it destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over. So it is that those of us who are yet determined that America will be are led down the path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land.\nAt this point I should make it clear that while I have tried in these last few minutes to give a voice to the voiceless in Vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who are called enemy, I am as deeply concerned about our own troops there as anything else. For it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and seek to destroy. We are adding cynicism to the process of death, for they must know after a short period there that none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved. Before long they must know that their government has sent them into a struggle among Vietnamese, and the more sophisticated surely realize that we are on the side of the wealthy, and the secure, while we create a hell for the poor.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. (January 15, 1929 -- April 4, 1968), was one of the main leaders of the American civil rights movement. A Baptist minister by training, King became a civil rights activist early in his career, leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott and helping to found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. His efforts led to the 1963 March on Washington, where King delivered his I Have a Dream speech, raising public consciousness of the civil rights movement and establishing King as one of the greatest orators in American history. In 1964, King became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other non-violent means.\n\nDr. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Martin Luther King Day was established as a national holiday in the United States in 1986. In 2004, King was posthumously awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.\nMartin Luther King - A Time to Break Silence\nMartin Luther King - A Time to Break Silence - Vietnam MLK Iraq\nMartin Luther King - A Time to Break Silence MLK Vietnam Iraq"

There are 3.5 million professional drivers in the US, all of whom may face job displacement in the autonomous future being developed by companies like Otto, Daimler, and Tesla. But before robots take the wheel entirely, there will be a long period where truckers and artificial technology split the responsibilities of the work. The first big step toward that future comes in the form of the electronic logging device, a dashboard monitor that tracks speed, location, and a driver's schedule, and reports it to an employer or a third-party monitoring service. It has a lot of truckers worried. \n\nRead Karen Levy's work here: \n \n the FMCSA's report on ELD safety:\n the NAS report on driving fatigue:\n is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Mark Hamill's Opinion Of The Last Jedi - The John Campea Show,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Wednesday, December 27th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon!   Supporter Spencer Smothers - Spencer Smothers - Hi John. You have talked before about how Netflix won't be hurt to much by Disney taking it's properties off Netflix. But with the Disney/Fox deal it's safe to assume that a similar thing will happen with all the newly acquired Fox properties. Two major company taking content off Netflix is a lot more significant than if just one did. \n\nMelissa Ramirez  - Looks like the sequel to Alien Covenent got cancelled just like you said it would. But really, is it any surprise? The last film did so badly, why did anyone still think a new one would happen?\n\nJacob Hickey - The box office results of Blade Runner 2019 has to rank amongst the biggest cinematic disappointments of 2017. Such a great movie, such a sad result. Ridley Scott is saying that the reason is did badly was the long running time. Do you agree with him?\n\nDion Debord - Hey John. Hope you‚Äôre having a great holiday season! With the debate going on about The Last Jedi, Mark Hamill has repeatedly stated his disappointment with the film. My question is, even if all film is subjective, if Luke Skywalker himself says the movie isn‚Äôt good, how can anyone still defend it?\n\nIntothefuture - Q: I have been looking forward to the Han Solo film coming out sometime i‚Äôm 2018.

This demagnetizer / degausser is purely mechanical, just what i hoped for. By using disc magnets, with the polarities arranged in an alternate pattern we can very effectively demagnetize the marbles by letting them enter and exit the alternating magnetic field. \n\nCheck out Play With Junks Youtubevideo that helped convince me of this method: \n I read on Wikipedia that magnetism is nowadays considered a truly quantum mechanical effect, one which can not be explained by classical physics. Maybe that's why we never stop being mesmerized by magnetism. \n\nWe missed last Wednesday cause of problems with the video  again, will work hard to not miss out on Wednesdays like that.\n\nSome of you might see a Sponsor button that have popped up next to the subscribe button on the Wintergatan Channel. Its not shown all the time or on every platform. I am making an announcement video explaining this function but thought i just quickly mention what it is.

We don't have a active Patreon page but recently Youtube reached out and asked us if we wanted to Beta-Test the Sponsorship function and we said yes. This function have been available for gaming channels for a long time but now Youtube is trying it out for other kinds of channels as well. Basically its a way for all of you who have asked us to start a Patreon page to support the Channel. More info on this in the upcoming channel update! \n\nAnyway, happy that Youtube reached out on this and happy that we found a mechanical way to demagnetize the marbles! \nHave a nice day everyone// Martin\n\nThanks to www.supermagnete.de for supporting the project by sending me the magnets for the Marble Machine X, these were the disc magnets used in the video:\nS-20-04-N Disc magnet:  you want to support what we do: \n\n‚òÖSUBSCRIBE TO WINTERGATAN ON YOUTUBE  WINTERGATAN MUSIC  \n\n‚òÖBUY PHYSICAL RECORDS OF WINTERGATAN MUSIC  \n\n‚òÖLISTEN TO WINTERGATAN ON SPOTIFY  \n\n‚òÖLISTEN TO WINTERGATAN ON ITUNES  \n\n‚òÖSPONSOR The Wintergatan Channel on Youtube\n\nVideo Made by Martin Molin & Hannes Trainerds Knutsson\nSound mixed by Charlie Johansson\nEndscreen animation by Elinor Bergman"

Owners want stadiums.\n\nWatch how NFL rule changes made linemen gigantic:  to our channel!  the past 20 years, over $7 billion in public money has gone towards financing the construction and renovation of NFL football stadiums. Owners argue that public investment in private football franchises will bring a boom of economic activity to  local economies. But this argument doesn‚Äôt hold up. In reality, stadiums and their upkeep wind up costing cities millions of dollars. \n\nFor owners, new stadiums mean more profits. They get to host the Super Bowl, sell naming rights to other corporations, and build increasingly opulent and expensive premium seating.\n\nFor cities, nabbing an itinerant football franchise looking for a new home field can be a big political win. And residents want teams and the hometown pride that comes with it.

Why isn‚Äôt ‚ÄòOff to the Vet‚Äô available in full on YouTube? A. ‚ÄòOff to the Vet‚Äô film production and crowdfunding campaign was a huge undertaking for the Simon‚Äôs Cat Team. Our hope is to produce more long form, full colour content for our fans but without having to turn to them through crowdfunding again. The film was completed in 2015 and submitted it to a selection of international film festivals over the following months. During this time, it was exclusively available to all funders that contributed via our private production blog. The feedback we have received from our funders has been overwhelming positive and we hope they are extremely proud of making the film a possibility. If you are a funder and have any questions regarding the campaign, please contact us at igg@simonscat.com\n\nQ. What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Even though the films are made on computer software, they are still hand-animated in a traditional manner, frame to frame. It usually takes between 12 and 25 drawings to create 1 second of a Simon's Cat film.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon‚Äôs Cat merchandise?\nA.

I first noticed this in the UK in 2004 but have since been able to replicate the experiment several times here in Australia and more recently captured it on video.\n\nInitially I noticed that a swarm of gnats above me seemed to slow their frantic movement when I started to speak and after a little experimentation I discovered that certain higher pitched vocals would cause the flies to noticeably rise upwards as a group and then rapidly drop downwards again upon ceasing the tone.\n\nI've noticed this both with gnats in a forest environment and also with sand fly swarms at the beach. What's also interesting is the flies seem to have excellent hearing over quite some distance as I have seen them reacting to a dog barking perhaps 50m away.\n\nI'd be interested to know if anyone has ever noticed this insect behaviour before or been able to capture it on video. If you happen to be an entomologist I'd also be interested in discussing this with you.
